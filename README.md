## Getting Started

## Architecture

`Settings.sol` has global controls for all markets. Any change here would affect all markets deployed by a single Opinion Market Deployer
`PayMaster.sol` a small contract that can be used to approve newly deployed opinion markets as spender of user funds. Creates a better UX with only a single approval necessary. 
`OpinionMarketDeployer.sol` uses the two previous mentioned contracts to orcastrate the deployment of new markets
`OpinionMarket.sol` has the core logic for the site. Every contract is designed to run non stop based on a series of rules. The operator has a lot of control over this because users require him to reveal on their behalf.
`ReferralProgram.sol` Keeps track of a user referrals. Users can earn a percentage of the fees generated by their referrals.
